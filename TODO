These features make the artifical player more like a smart Nethack player:

 Add crowning behavior: a powerful player with access to an altar will
 hang around the altar, kill monsters, and sacrifice each one.

These features make the WFTM world more like the Nethack world:

 Assign multipliers to each role to reflect the fact that
 some roles are easier to play.

 Add something to simulate the way that a player gets disproportionately
 powerful at around dungeon level 15, once the powerful magic items
 start coming.

These are Nethack features missing from WFTM:

 Add "You feel [very] close to {player}" messages on sacrifice.

 Add crowning option when "very close". Note that prayer timeouts
 increase when a player is crowned, so Player.resetPrayerTimeout()
 will have to be changed. From spoilers:

  Your god give you a favourable answer to a prayer		=random(350)
   - when you are the Hand of Elbereth (additional)		+random(1000)
   - when you are the Envoy of Balance (additional)		+random(2000)
   - when you are the Glory of Arioch (additional)		+random(3000)

 Add the disintegration beam form of the lightning bolt punishment.

 The player might make sacrifices from another god's altar, or make
 inappropriate sacrifices like self-aligned unicorns, which will tend
 to anger you.

 The player might even kick your altars over!

 The player might go over to another god in your pantheon. They might
 come back, or win or die as a servant of the other god.

 There is a small chance that a player will sacrifice the Amulet to
 another god in the endgame.

These features are WFTM-specific enhancements:

 Add role-specific prayers 

 Add god-specific names used in prayers (eg. the stereotypical
 "grey-eyed Athena").

WFTM uses a couple of recipes from the Python cookbook:

 "getch()-like unbuffered character reading from stdin on both Windows
  and Unix"
 By Danny Yoo
 http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/134892

 "one-liner word-wrap function"
 By Mike Brown
 http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/148061

WFTM uses the introductory text from NetHack. I don't know who wrote
that specific text, but it may have been Izchak Miller.

WFTM quotes spoiler information from:

 "Amulets and their properties in NetHack 3.4"
